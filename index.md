Since 2017, I have been working as a researcher in the Cryptography
Research Group at UCLouvain, Belgium under the supervision of Professor [F.-X.
Standaert](https://perso.uclouvain.be/fstandae/). I received my PhD on January
2022 which was focusing on the evaluation and implementation of side-channel
countermeasures. I am now a post-doc in the same research group. 


I am also a co-founder of the [SIMPLE-crypto](https://www.simple-crypto.dev/)
non-profit organization which aims at providing open-source implementation
resistant against physical attacks.
