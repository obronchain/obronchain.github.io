Since 2017, I have been working as a researcher in the Cryptography
Research Group at UCLouvain, Belgium under the supervision of Professor [F.-X.
Standaert](https://perso.uclouvain.be/fstandae/). I received my PhD on January
2022 which was focusing on the evaluation and implementation of side-channel
countermeasures. I am now a post-doc in the same research group. 

# PhD Short description

My PhD dissertation is composed of two parts.

## Security evaluation

The first part focuses on the evaluation of cryptographic implementation
against side-channel attacks. Before my research, defining the security of an
implementation was either performed in abstract mathematical models providing
(too) strong guarantees or in real world scenario where the conclusions could
be biased. Since 2017, I have been working on closing the gap between these two
extreme approaches by mixing both concrete power measurements, proofs and sound
statistical inference heuristics. This resulted in a new efficient security
evaluation methodology that is now publicly available with the open-source
library [SCALib](https://github.com/simple-crypto/SCALib) I have been leading
the development together with Gaëtan Cassiers.  One of my main contributions is
the application of this methodology to one implementation of the French
“Agence Nationale de la Sécurité des Systèmes d'Information'' (ANSSI).  It
resulted in  efficient attacks against ANSSI’s SCA protected implementation.

## New secure designs
The second part is dedicated to the design of cryptography implementation.
Among others, I have been implementing cryptography for embedded software, FPGA
designs and I have been part of the [Spook](https://www.spook.dev/) team for
the lightweight cryptography competition organized by the American “National
Institute of Standards and Technology”.
