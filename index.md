# Biography

Since 2017, I have been working as a PhD researcher in the Cryptography Research Group at UCLouvain, Belgium under the supervision of Professor [F.-X. Standaert](https://perso.uclouvain.be/fstandae/). My research was funded by an European Research Council grant who employed more than 10 top international  researchers. 
My thesis focuses on side-channel attacks (SCA) which allow to break cryptographic algorithms by observing physical signals such as power consumption or execution time. My thesis is composed of two parts.

# Research Interests
## Security evaluation
The first part focuses on the evaluation of cryptographic implementation against side-channel attacks. Before my research, defining the security of an implementation was either performed in abstract mathematical models providing (too) strong guarantees or in real world scenario where the conclusions could be biased. Since 2017, I have been working on closing the gap between these two extreme approaches by mixing both concrete power measurements, proofs and sound statistical inference heuristics. This resulted in a new efficient security evaluation methodology that is now publicly available with the open-source library [SCALib](https://github.com/simple-crypto/SCALib) I have been leading the development. 
One of my main contributions is the application of this methodology to one implementation of the French  “Agence Nationale de la Sécurité des Systèmes d'Information'' (ANSSI).  It resulted in  efficient attacks against ANSSI’s SCA protected implementation.

## New secure designs
The second part is dedicated to the design of cryptography implementation. Among others, I have been implementing cryptography for embedded software, FPGA designs and I have been part of the [Spook](https://www.spook.dev/) team for the lightweight cryptography competition organized by the American “National Institute of Standards and Technology”.
