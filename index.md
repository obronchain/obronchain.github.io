In 2017, I started to work as a researcher in the Cryptography
Research Group at UCLouvain, Belgium under the supervision of Professor [F.-X.
Standaert](https://perso.uclouvain.be/fstandae/). I received my PhD on January
2022 which was focusing on the evaluation and implementation of side-channel
countermeasures. I am now working at NXP Semiconductors, Belgium, where I am mostly 
focusing on the deployment of post-quantum cryptography into embedded systems. 


I am also a co-founder of the [SIMPLE-crypto](https://www.simple-crypto.dev/)
non-profit organization which aims at providing open-source implementation
resistant against physical attacks. 

# Research interest

## Post-Quantum Cryptography.
I am currently focusing on the challenges related to the deployment of post-quantum 
cryptography in embedded systems. This includes low-memory implementations as well 
as side-channel countermeasures dedicated to post-quantum cryptography. As an example, 
I contributed to masking [CRYSTALS-Kyber](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/158) and [CRYSTALS-Dilithium](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/1406), and low-memory [FrodoKEM](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/158).

## Side-Channel security evaluations. 

I am interested in the evaluation of open-source implementations resistant
against side-channel attacks, which is the main focus of my [PhD thesis](https://dial.uclouvain.be/pr/boreal/object/boreal:258155).
I contributed to [SCALib](https://github.com/simple-crypto/SCALib) which is a library dedicated
to side-channel analysis with a strong focus on performances and simplicity.

## Software Side-channel protected implementations.

I am also interested in protected implementations against side-channel attacks. 
Among other, I have been working on the software implementations used in the 
[CHES 2020 CTF](https://ctf.spook.dev/) and co-authored implementation of 
`Saber` and `Kyber` masked at arbitrary order. That code has been released with 
an open-source license [here](https://github.com/uclcrypto/pqm4_masked).
