Since 2017, I have been working as a researcher in the Cryptography
Research Group at UCLouvain, Belgium under the supervision of Professor [F.-X.
Standaert](https://perso.uclouvain.be/fstandae/). I received my PhD on January
2022 which was focusing on the evaluation and implementation of side-channel
countermeasures. I am now a post-doc in the same research group. 


I am also a co-founder of the [SIMPLE-crypto](https://www.simple-crypto.dev/)
non-profit organization which aims at providing open-source implementation
resistant against physical attacks. 

# Research interest

## Side-Channel security evaluations. 

I am interested in the evaluation of open-source implementations resistant
against side-channel attacks. I contributed to
[SCALib](https://github.com/simple-crypto/SCALib) which is a library dedicated
to side-channel analysis with a strong focus on performances and simplicity.

## Software Side-channel protected implementations.

I am also interested in protected implementations against side-channel attacks. 
Among other, I have been working on the software implementations used in the 
[CHES 2020 CTF](https://ctf.spook.dev/) and co-authored implementation of 
`Saber` and `Kyber` masked at arbitrary order. That code has been released with 
an open-source license [here](https://github.com/uclcrypto/pqm4_masked).
